ceratotomia-radial
==================

[Radial Keratotomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_keratotomy) surgery advisor. From the time this kind of surgeries were made using knifes, not lasers!

## History ##

This pascal code was written as of late 1986. By February of 1987 I broke my glasses and the oftalmologist who I written this code for offered me free surgery using parameters produced by __THIS CODE__! That's what I call trust on code quality!!

Well, as of today (July 22th, 2012) I still don't need glasses! #BigWin

## Technical Detais ##

This is Turbo Pascal 3 code, so written for MSDOS 3.x. For convenience the repo adds executable code that was tested with DOSBox 0.74.
